# The Five Essential Phone-Screen Questions

> I've been on a lot of SDE interview loops lately where the candidate failed miserably: not-inclined votes all around, even from the phone screeners who brought the person in initially. 

最近我参加了几轮高级软件开发工程师的面试，但很多候选人都不幸失败了：周围全是不赞成，即便是最初推荐候选人的电话面试官，都投了否定票。

> It's usually pretty obvious when the candidate should have been eliminated during the phone screens. Well, it's obvious in retrospect, anyway: during the interviews, we find some horrible flaw in the candidate which, had anyone thought to ask about it during the phone screen, would surely have disqualified the person. 

通常情况下，很明显这些候选人在电话面试时就应该被淘汰。不管怎么说，回想起来还是很明显的: 在面试过程中，我们发现了候选人身上的一些可怕的缺陷，如果有人想在电话面试时问这些问题，那么这个人肯定会被取消面试资格。

> But we didn't ask. So the candidate came in for interviews and wound up wasting everyone's time. 

但我们没有问，所以候选人来参与面试，最终浪费大家的时间。



## 反模式（Antipatterns）

> I've done informal postmortems on at least a hundred phone screens, many of them my own. Whenever a candidate bombs the interviews, I want to know what went wrong with the screen. And guess what? A pattern has emerged. Two patterns, actually.

我对至少100次电话面试做过非正式的事后分析，其实很多都是我自己的。当候选人把一场面试搞砸时，我想知道到底哪里出错了。你猜怎样？一种模式出现了，事实上，是两种模式。

> The first pattern is that for most failed phone screens, *the candidate did most of the talking.* The screener only asked about stuff on the candidate's resume, and the candidate was able to talk with passion and enthusiasm about this incredibly cool thing they did, blah blah blah, and the screener was duly impressed. 

第一种模式是，对于多数电话面试，候选人一直在说，面试官只问候选人简历上的内容，而候选人满怀激情的谈论他们所做的非常酷的事情，等等等等，面试官对此印象深刻。

> That's how many/most phone screens go wrong. 

这就是很多或者说绝大多数电话面试是如何变糟的。

> The right way to do a phone screen is to do most of the talking, or at least the driving. You look for specific answers, and you guide the conversation along until you've got the answer or you've decided the candidate doesn't know it. Whenever I forget this, and get lazy and let the candidate drone on about their XML weasel-pin connector project, I wind up bringing in a dud. 

完成电话面试的正确方式应该是面试官来做大部分谈话，或者至少主导谈话过程。你寻求特定的答案，你需要引导谈话过程，直到你得到了答案或者判断候出选人并不知道答案。每当我忘了这一点，或者变懒而被候选人用他们的XML weasel-pin connector项目牵着走，电话面试最终功亏一篑。

> The second pattern is that *one-trick ponies only know one trick.* Candidates who have programmed mostly in a single language (e.g. C/C++), platform (e.g. AIX) or framework (e.g. J2EE) usually have major, gaping holes in their skills lineup. These candidates will fail their interviews here because our interviews cover a broad range of skill areas. 

第二种模式是，只有一技之长的人真的只知道一技之长。多数时间使用一种语言（例如C/C++）、一个平台（例如AIX）或者框架（例如J2EE）进行开发的候选人，他们的技能序列是有很大缺陷的。由于我们的面试涵盖广泛的技能领域，这些候选人会在面试中失败。

> These two phone screen (anti-)patterns are related: if you only ask the candidate about what they know, you've got a fairly narrow view of their abilities. And you're setting yourself up for a postmortem on your phone screen.

这两种电话面试的（反）模式是相互联系的。如果你只问候选人知道的东西，你对他们的能力的看法会非常狭隘。也会在之后做电话面试事后分析时，让自己深陷困境。
