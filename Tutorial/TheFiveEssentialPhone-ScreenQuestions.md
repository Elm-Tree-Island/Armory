> I've been on a lot of SDE interview loops lately where the candidate failed miserably: not-inclined votes all around, even from the phone screeners who brought the person in initially. 

最近我参加了几轮高级软件开发工程师的面试，但很多候选人都不幸失败了：周围全是不赞成，即便是最初推荐候选人的电话面试官，都投了否定票。

> It's usually pretty obvious when the candidate should have been eliminated during the phone screens. Well, it's obvious in retrospect, anyway: during the interviews, we find some horrible flaw in the candidate which, had anyone thought to ask about it during the phone screen, would surely have disqualified the person. 

通常情况下，很明显这些候选人在电话面试时就应该被淘汰。不管怎么说，回想起来还是很明显的: 在面试过程中，我们发现了候选人身上的一些可怕的缺陷，如果有人想在电话面试时问这些问题，那么这个人肯定会被取消面试资格。

> But we didn't ask. So the candidate came in for interviews and wound up wasting everyone's time. 

但我们没有问，所以候选人来参与面试，最终浪费大家的时间。
